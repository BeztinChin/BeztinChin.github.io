##Syntex in python:
1. open("...","") 
<br/>*first arg is the path and the second is for assign a specialied way to open*
<br/>*"w" for overwriting a file and when the file is opened as this way, the orginal content is delete.
<br/>'a' for adding new content to the file.
<br/>'r' for just reading and this is the default*
2. file.write("")
<br/>*first arg is the content and you can ues \n in the str to change the line*
<br/>*this method can also return the len of the str.*
3. file.read(6)
<br/>*from the current cursor position read the following 6 bytes*
<br/>*if the first arg is omitted ,it will read the rest contents from current position*
<br/>*this will return a str.*
4. files.readlines()
<br/>*from the current cursor position read the lines by lines*
<br/>*the element of the list is the str of lines*
<br/>*this will return a list.*
<br/>*also you can use **for** loop to iterate the file as following and this will return a str.*
5.file.close()
<br/>*Dont forget to close whenever you open a file.*
<br/>*you can use the **with** syntax.*
<br/>*you can use the **try...finally..** syntax.*
<br/><br/>
```javascript
with open("waht.txt","w") as f :
  msg= ['What do you want to say?\n',' can u clearly tell me ??\n']

  print(num)
with open("waht.txt","a") as f:
  msg= 'What do you want to say?\n can u clearly tell me ??'
  f.write(msg)
    
try:
  file= open("waht.txt",'r')
  content_str= file.read(4)
  print(type(content_str))
  print(content_str)
  print(file.read(8))
  for lines in file:
    print(lines)
    print(type(lines))
  content_list= file.readlines()
  print(type(content_list))
  print(content_list)
